Approach:
The idea we followed to make an effective realistic model from this data was to take only that data which is present to the lending group at the time of application and basis of that we predicted whether that person is likely to default or not. We removed information such as loan disbursement date, interest rate, loan approval date to avoid data leakage.

Our final model came out to be XGBoost Classifier with train accuracy of 95 percent and test accuracy of 94 percent.
